## Notes:

- used the `fast-csv` to read the csv and  `moment` to format and calculate the time diff.
- order matching was done to O(n) (excluding the CSV reading time)
- folder structure is kept as-is since the data layer was not implemented.
- **TODO** : logs, caching, service isolation (routes, model), custom data types, add swagger for docs.
